# Planned Features & Ideas

- Redirect to newly created nodes
- refactor node system to work more like an extensible plugin system
- refactor css into a theming system
- customizable backgrounds users can set, customizable color schemes
- general file uploads
- refresh tokens
- code editor for certain filetypes
- text card node type (like text but with a small character limit so they fit completely on the cards)
- option for server admins or whoever to toggle which node types can be used
- look into using websockets for things
- notifications system which can dynamically resurface old content based on things like linkStrength and association relations
- web scraping features for url uploads and updates to url input parsing
- possibly adding certain commands which can be run via IO bar, parameters which can be passed in
- refactor image and file upload system to all work through the same backend endpoint
- help page with useful links
- ability to use the same client for multiple backend instances

- simple image editor
- make it easy to create and manage multiple user accounts, personas, like on tumblr
- ability to link in external files for on-device use-cases
- port to electron
- simple video editor
- possibly add some kind of setup wizard if needed
- see if associations can work as part of a sort of 3D rendering engine
- some sort of update system where users can subscribe to update feeds for the app or something
- csurf security on server and corresponding updates to clientside
- rate limiting on server
- security checkthrough generally
- permission system for how nodes are shared on a public server
- import/export all data
- custom import/export from a specific node outward, with specific parameters allowed including associations in a given radius
- use some graphing library to let users visualize their data about themselves
- infinite additional node types
  - forms node type, forms system
  - synthona instances as node types
  - hyperimages
  - ml models
  - 3D models
  - hyperobjects
  - audio files
  - video streams
  - video files
  - nodes which can modify other nodes automatically under certain conditions
- not posting everything here yet! this is just a start, got pages and pages of more interesting features planned as well
